Development notes:
- The app integrates with the backend via REST endpoints defined in src/api/client.js.
- JWT token and user are persisted as localStorage keys:
  - animaltrackr_jwt
  - animaltrackr_user
- ProtectedRoute in App.js restricts access to authenticated users, and optional roles.
- Map uses Leaflet with OSM. To use Mapbox, add Mapbox map container and set REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN.
- Offline:
  - sw.js caches static and GET responses and background-syncs POST /telemetry and /camera-trap/upload.
  - OfflineSyncIndicator surfaces connectivity and sync hints.
- WebSocket:
  - REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL is used by useRealtime hook for live telemetry/alerts.
